# Orthology Inference

Linking a specific evolutionary pattern to a phenotypic trait

### Creation of a Dataset:

NCBI is recommended for retrieving data. Select genomes that are:
* Annotated
* Scaffold-level assembly
* Published after 2010

Check that the genomes are properly annotated → open the genome page and look at the representative statistics describing the genome; also review Annotation Details.

* Note the RefSeq accession number (unique identifier).
* Use NCBI Datasets to download a genome by its accession number.

Create a table with the following structure:

* First column: accession number of the chosen species
* Tab
* Second column: scientific name
* Tab
* Third column: unique ID (a string that represents the species in a simple way --> 3 letters for the genus and 3 for the species)
